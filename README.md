# NodeSDR

## NodeSDR is a network enabled software defined radio application. 

The application makes remote SDR operation easy. By providing a simple interface to connect remote NodeSDR instances (Nodes) together, remote SDR control, data decoding and streaming over the network are all possible.

A collection of core decoding modules are provided out of the box. Don't see what you want? that's ok! The application has been designed with extensibility in mind, making it easy to add new capabilities through your own custom built modules. Simply create your module, drop it into the application, wire up your routing and you're good to go!

***This application is under active development.***
